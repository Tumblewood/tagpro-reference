[TagPro Reference](https://www.tagpro-reference.com) is a website for viewing the stats and history of competitive [TagPro](https://tagpro.gg) leagues, current and historical.

It's similar to [TagPro League](https://www.tagproleague.com), but it makes the following key improvements:

- Open source
- Better interface for viewing data from historical seasons
- Support for playoff stats
- Easier data entry process

The primary goal is to facilitate stat-keeping for past seasons that are not well-served by TagPro League. However, the site still functions for current season stat-keeping much like TPL does.

# Roadmap

TagPro Reference is not complete. Here are the remaining features needed, from a development perspective:

- Better handling of edge cases (overtime games, games that are stopped and restarted)
- Advanced stats (like GASP and NISH)

There are some further additions that would be nice to have as well:

- Playoff brackets
- Displays for season awards and transaction history
- Easier workflow for finding and correcting erroneous data
- Easier data entry workflow for out-of-game information (like awards)

# Contribution

If you want to help the TagPro Reference project, the main way you can contribute is by **entering historical data**. There are dozens of seasons of competitive TagPro missing from the site. If you would like to help input data from one of those seasons, please message me and I will help you get started.

You can contribute data for any competitive league, including leagues for alternate gamemodes like neutral flag and eggball. For reference on how long data entry takes, the initial pass for NALTP S32 took me 1 and a half hours. (Seasons with worse documentation will take longer.)

If you would like to help in other ways, here are some of the other areas where I could use help:

- Procurement of quality images for awards, league trophies, and a site logo
- Code for remaining roadmap features

Please consult with me before trying to contribute, so I can make sure we're on the same page about the feature and how it should be implemented.
